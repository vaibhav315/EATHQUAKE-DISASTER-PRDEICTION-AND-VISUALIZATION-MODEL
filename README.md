# EATHQUAKE-DISASTER-PRDEICTION-AND-VISUALIZATION-MODEL
This project uses machine learning to classify earthquake magnitudes into risk categories (Low, Moderate, High) based on features like depth, location, and tsunami impact. It also visualizes major earthquakes on an interactive heatmap using Folium for easy geographical analysis.
