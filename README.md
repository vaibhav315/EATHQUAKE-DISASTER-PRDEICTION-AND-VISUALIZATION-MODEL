# EATHQUAKE-DISASTER-PRDEICTION-AND-VISUALIZATION-MODEL
This project uses machine learning to classify earthquake magnitudes into risk categories (Low, Moderate, High) based on features like depth, location, and tsunami impact. It also visualizes major earthquakes on an interactive heatmap using Folium for easy geographical analysis.

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify earthquake magnitudes into severity categories (Low, Moderate, High) and visualize significant earthquake events using an interactive heatmap. It is split into two main components:
1)dataset.py: ML-based magnitude classification using Random Forest.
           Confusion Matrix visualized via Seaborn.
           Classification Report showing precision, recall, and F1-score.
           Prediction printed for a hypothetical earthquake input.

2)map.py: Interactive visualization of high-magnitude earthquakes using Folium.
